## What is LangChain？ 
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:
* Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
* Be agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment
The LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.
